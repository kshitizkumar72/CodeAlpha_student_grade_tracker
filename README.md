This program prompts the user (teacher) to enter the number of students, then allows the teacher to input the grades for each student. It uses an ArrayList to store the grades since the number of students may vary. After inputting all the grades, it calculates the average, highest, and lowest grades using methods from the Collections class.

Make sure to import the necessary classes (ArrayList, Collections, and Scanner) at the beginning of your Java file.

You can extend this program further by adding error handling for invalid input, such as non-numeric grades or negative numbers. Additionally, you can include more functionalities like calculating median, mode, and standard deviation.
